## Module 11 Challenge Submission

This submission consists of 2 parts. 
Part 1 involved extracting entries from an online HTML website using automated webscraping libraries in Python. The resulting tables and preview text objects were placed in a dictionary for reference.

Part 2 involved extracting entries from an online HTML table, also using webscraping libraries in Python. This was more involved as analysis was performed on the data. Using BeautifulSoup and Pandas, the numeric data from the API key was analyzed and some questions answered using the analysis and generated visuals.
